Intelligent Learning System

This project is an Intelligent Learning System designed to enhance K-12 mathematics education by providing personalized content recommendations and automated tagging of educational materials. The system uses advanced AI models, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and layout analysis, to extract key concepts and map them to educational standards like the Common Core. The application is built using a scalable architecture with Angular (frontend), Django (backend), and PostgreSQL (database), containerized using Docker for seamless development and deployment.
